Given two non-empty arrays of Integers, write a function that determines whether the second array Is a subsequence of the first
one.

A subsequence of an array is a set of numbers that aren't necessarily adjacent In the array but that are In the same order as they
appear in the array. For Instance, the numbers `[1, 3, 4]` form a subsequence of the array `[1, 2, 3, 4]` ,and so do the 
numbers `[2, 4]`. Note that a single number in an array and the array itself are both valid subsequences of the array.

```
Sample Input
array = [5, 1, 22, 25, 6, -1, 8, 10]
sequence = [1, 6, -1, 18] 

Sample Output
true 3
